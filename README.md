# SAS

In this repository I upload SAS sample codes. I wrote these codes based on 
[officaial SAS tutorials](https://video.sas.com/detail/videos/how-to-tutorials/video/4573016758001/creating-a-sas-table-from-a-csv-file?autoStart=true). 

This repository will be completing as I go through learning process.
