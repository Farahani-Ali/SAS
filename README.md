# SAS

In this repository I upload SAS sample codes. I wrote these codes based on official tutorials of SAS (https://video.sas.com/detail/videos/how-to-tutorials/video/4573016758001/creating-a-sas-table-from-a-csv-file?autoStart=true "officaial SAS tutorials). 
This section will be completed as I learn how to code in SAS.
